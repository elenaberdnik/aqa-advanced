# QA Automation Project 🚀

This is my **first QA Automation project**, created to practice setting up a Node.js environment, working with Git/GitHub, and writing simple automation scripts.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`package.json` / `package-lock.json`** – project dependencies and configuration.  
- **`.gitignore`** – ignored files and folders (e.g. `node_modules`).  
- **`index.js`** – sample JavaScript file with styled console outputs using [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk).  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Node.js**  
- **npm**  
- **Chalk** (for colorful console messages)  
- **Git & GitHub** (version control and collaboration)  

---

## 📖 Features
- Simple script demonstrating colored console logs:  
  ```js
  console.log(chalk.blue('Hello world!'));
  console.log(chalk.green('Automation is running...'));
  console.log(chalk.red('Error: Something went wrong!'));
